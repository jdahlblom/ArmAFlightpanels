# ArmAFlightpanels

ArmAFP's primary role is supporting the Saitek / Logitech Pro Flight Hardware in ArmA!
Together, with ArmA 3' Windowed Instrument Navigation Guidance System, WINGS; a
pilot can use various Pro Flight panels to operate cockpit radio equipment and display an
array of flight data from the in-game aircraft. Furthermore, this app is also a key emulator.

Using ArmAFP as a general Key Emulator, players can enjoy games such as Flaming Cliffs,
IL-2, War Thunder, Elite Dangerous or any other game using the legendary saitek panels..!
